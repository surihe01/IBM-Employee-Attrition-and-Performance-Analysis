# Introduction
In a work environment, employee attrition refers to a reduction or decrease in the number of employees within an organization due to natural or voluntary reasons. There are many factors that can lead high labor force attrition rate: work-life balance, compensations and benefits, job satisfaction, lack of career development, organizational culture and work environment, etc. Since employee attrition is an essential indicator for human resource management within a company, our project aims to **discover the factors that affect employee attrition** based on fictional datasets generated by IBM data scientists.

# About Dataset

Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
